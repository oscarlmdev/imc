## BMI Calculator page

This is a simple webpage which calculates the user's **BMI**(*Body Mass Index, IMC in Spanish*) and gives some usefull YouTube information as feedback based on the result.
It uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's pretty simple, but it helped me initiate on how to use JS to add interactivity to the page and learning how to use JSON
to store data in localStorage to create a simple history system.
